<span>One of the threats to Ghana's democracy currently is politicians and those with influence paying a group of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1485597364022829058">young</a> people to spread fake news, misinformation and malign people 
These people are investing so much into it because they know many are ignorant and social media is big</span>
<span>@GraemeKelly1 @LFC_Ireland78 I know people hate hearing it, but if you've got a British passport you will always have that advantage over a foreign player. Homegrown players are at a huge premium, so options are buy <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1485597359279165441">young</a>, develop from the academy or pay a huge premium. I think that explains Hendo, imo.</span>
<span>@wsbtv Why don't they care about these lives? They look so <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1485597355810467840">young</a> and had a lot of life left. I wish we would care more about the lives of others as well as our own lives and the lives of our loved ones. All life is important. God help us. Prayers to the families.</span>
<span>I loved this post anyway, because of the love shining out from father to son, but there are so many comments from top athletes &amp; teams, even god himself @Robbie9Fowler has commented, it’s wonderful to see social media coming together to support a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1485597350450061316">young</a> lad &amp; his awesome dad 😍 https://t.co/AkTWPrfPlm</span>

<span>@fred_guttenberg This is awful, why should a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1485597325577834498">young</a> person who decides at the height of emotion be allowed to carry a weapon?</span>
